Hi,

At home I often had the problem, the door of the fridge in the cellar don't close exactly, thie failture is versy power consuming and resutl in a total icy fridge.

There is no notification or arlame when thats happend.

It would be nice if Alexa reminds you that the door is not correctly closed.

After the Door from the Fridge is open, the trigger is switch and waiting 2 minutes befor Alexa say "Hello, the Fridge Door ist open.


Greetings Torsten
